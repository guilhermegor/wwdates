# `.github/` — CI and recurrent automation

Guidance for Claude Code and contributors working in this project's `.github/`.

## What ships by default

The scaffold ships **event-driven** CI only — workflows triggered by `push` and
`pull_request`. Nothing here runs on a clock. That is deliberate: a scheduled
job runs whether or not anyone needs it, costs runner minutes, and can fail
silently long after the person who added it has moved on.

**Add a time-triggered job only when the project genuinely needs one, and write
down *why* in the workflow file.**

## Recurrent (scheduled) workflows

To run a workflow on a schedule, add an `on.schedule` trigger with a cron
expression:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * 1'   # 03:00 UTC every Monday
  workflow_dispatch: {}    # also allow a manual run from the Actions tab
```

Gotchas that bite people:

- **Cron is UTC**, always — not your local timezone. Convert deliberately.
- **Minimum granularity is 5 minutes**; anything finer is rejected.
- **Runs can be delayed** (sometimes by many minutes) when GitHub's runner pool
  is busy — never rely on exact timing.
- **Scheduled workflows auto-disable after ~60 days of repository inactivity**
  (no pushes). They resume only when someone pushes or re-enables them.
- Always pair `schedule` with `workflow_dispatch` so you can trigger a run
  on demand without waiting for the next tick.

Common legitimate uses: nightly end-to-end tests, a scheduled CodeQL / security
scan, a stale-issue/PR bot, cache warming, scheduled data refresh.

## Dependency updates (Dependabot)

Dependabot version updates are a worked example of "recurrent automation". They
live in `.github/dependabot.yml`, and the `schedule.interval` key is
**mandatory** — there is no manual-only cadence. Pick one:

- `daily` — fast-moving app with active maintainers watching the PR queue.
- `weekly` — the typical default.
- `monthly` — low-churn project or a stable library.

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"          # "pip" for Python projects; also "docker", "gomod", …
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"              # daily | weekly | monthly — choose per project
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

### Want updates with no cadence?

Enable **Dependabot security updates** instead — they are *event-driven* (a PR
opens only when a CVE advisory matches a dependency), need **no**
`dependabot.yml`, and run on no schedule at all. Turn them on in
*Settings → Code security → Dependabot*, or via the API:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/vulnerability-alerts
gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/automated-security-fixes
```
