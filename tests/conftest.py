"""Pytest configuration: make real network access impossible during tests.

A unit test that reaches the network is a latent hazard: in CI it runs on every
push from many IPs, so a single un-mocked download can get the project
rate-limited or IP-banned from the very source it depends on. "Mock at the I/O
boundary" is a prose rule — it holds only while every contributor remembers it.
This autouse guard makes the violation *impossible* rather than merely
discouraged: it swaps the connection primitives (``socket.socket.connect`` /
``connect_ex`` and ``socket.create_connection``) for versions that raise
:class:`NetworkAccessError`, naming what was reached and what to mock instead. A
test that genuinely must hit the wire opts out with
``@pytest.mark.allow_network`` (registered in ``pytest.ini``).

Only the **connection** primitives are blocked, not ``socket.getaddrinfo`` — a
bare DNS/address resolution neither exfiltrates data nor triggers a rate-limit
ban (the connection does), and offline SSRF/address classification legitimately
resolves an address to decide whether to connect at all. ``create_connection``
resolves *and* connects, so the hostname path is still caught there.
