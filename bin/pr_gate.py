"""PR quality gate — label, report, and (only for low-risk classes) hand the merge to GitHub.

.. warning::

   **STATUS IN THIS REPO (wwdates): only the classifier is live.**

   This file is a verbatim port from ``filings-cvm`` (issue #26). Of everything it describes,
   **wwdates uses exactly one thing**: :func:`classify_risk`, imported by
   ``bin/check_backlog_ledger.py`` to decide whether a branch's paths oblige it to carry a work
   ledger. That import is the single reason the file is here, and it keeps the definition of
   "src/ci path" identical across the three sibling repos instead of forking it.

   **Everything else below is inert.** :func:`main` is wired to **no workflow**; nothing in
   ``.github/`` invokes it. It would also fail fast if run by hand — it reads
   ``os.environ["PR_NUMBER"]`` and raises ``KeyError`` outside a CI PR context. Do not wire it up
   without reading the next paragraph.

   **These statements in the prose below are TRUE OF filings-cvm AND FALSE HERE** — kept because
   the port is deliberately verbatim, flagged because a tracked file that lies outranks anyone's
   memory:

   - There is **no auto-merge** in wwdates. No ``pr-quality-gate`` ruleset, no
     ``risk:*``/``size:*``/``gate:*`` labels, no ``do-not-merge`` opt-out label, and
     ``bin/enable_repo_rules.sh`` does not exist. Dependabot PRs here do **not** merge hands-free;
     they are reviewed like any other PR.
   - The ``_internal/config/contracts/`` / ``date_ref`` example is CVM-flavoured. wwdates does ship
     ``_internal/config/contracts/``, but its catastrophic-small-diff cases are calendar sources,
     not regulatory partitions.
   - The docs site here is **English**, not pt-BR; ``mkdocs.yml`` sets no ``theme.language``.

Three things happen here, in order:

1. **Classify** the PR from its changed paths (**risk class**) and its diff volume (**size
   bucket**), and apply the corresponding labels — ``risk:*``, ``size:*``, ``gate:*``.
2. **Report**: publish/update ONE sticky comment carrying the per-axis table (tests, CodeQL, docs
   build), so the gate's state is readable without opening the checks tab. The run **polls the
   checks in-place** until they finish, so the comment lands on the FINAL result instead of
   freezing on "running" — deliberately self-contained, because a `workflow_run` trigger only fires
   from the default branch's copy of the file and can never fire for the PR that introduces it.
3. **Auto-merge**: when the class is auto-mergeable (and the diff is not ``XL`` and nobody applied
   the ``do-not-merge`` opt-out), enable GitHub's *native* auto-merge (the
   ``enablePullRequestAutoMerge`` mutation, not ``PUT .../pulls/:n/merge``). GitHub holds it until
   **every required check of the `pr-quality-gate` ruleset is green** and merges by itself. This is
   **opt-OUT**: a `ci`/`deps`/`docs` PR auto-merges by default (no label), so routine changes —
   Dependabot's weekly bumps included — flow hands-free; ``do-not-merge`` stops a specific PR. It
   rests on two repo settings (`allow_auto_merge`, `delete_branch_on_merge`) provisioned by
   ``bin/enable_repo_rules.sh`` — without the first, the mutation silently no-ops.

**Why auto-MERGE and not auto-APPROVE.** The ruleset requires *0* approvals (a solo maintainer
cannot approve their own PR), so a bot approval would unblock nothing — it would be decorative.
Native auto-merge bypasses nothing either: the ruleset stays the single source of truth for what
must pass; this script only decides *eligibility*, never *whether the checks passed*.

**Why risk-by-PATH and not by diff size.** A small diff is not a safe diff here. The real failure
mode is semantic — a ``FileContract`` column grounded wrong, a ``date_ref`` selecting the wrong
partition, a money column parsed to ``float``. A **one-character** change under
``_internal/config/contracts/`` is tiny *and* catastrophic, and **every test still passes**,
because the tests assert the contract that was written. So ``src/`` is **never** auto-merged, at
any size.

Pure classification lives in module-level functions (unit-tested); every GitHub call is confined to
:func:`main` and the thin helpers it calls, so the logic is testable without a network.

**Language.** Everything this bot emits — the comment, the axis names, the labels — is **English**,
like every other contributor/machine-facing surface here (code, commit messages, CI output). Only
the **published documentation** follows the site's own language (`mkdocs.yml` ``theme.language``,
pt-BR). The boundary is the *audience*, not the repository.

	passed** — the ruleset does, and GitHub holds the merge until they are green.

	The XL veto asks "is this diff big enough that a human should look?". That question is
	meaningful for hand-written code and meaningless for a regenerated lockfile, whose size tracks
	how many dependency *hashes* moved, not how much risk arrived: Dependabot's routine bump of 3
	dev tools spanned 579 lines of ``poetry.lock`` (XL, vetoed) while a 2-package bump spanned
	fewer than 500 (L, merged). Left alone, the weekly bump self-merges or not depending on how

	``pyproject.toml`` is deliberately not included, since a hand-edited version range is exactly
	where dependency risk does live.

	Stopping the loop on that is the freeze bug this function exists to prevent: a CodeQL analysis
