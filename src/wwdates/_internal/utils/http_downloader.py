"""HTTP file-download seam (stdlib, SSRF-hardened).

One reusable place for "download a file from a URL". The transport uses the standard
library (``urllib.request``) so the skeleton stays dependency-free for peripheral I/O —
the same choice as ``webhook`` adapters. This is the **only** place network downloads
should happen (the "library coupling" seam rule in CLAUDE.md): callers depend on
``download_file``, not on a vendor API, so a transport change is confined here and tests
mock at this boundary.

**SSRF hardening.** When a URL can originate from untrusted input, a tampered value could
point the server at an internal host. Before fetching, the host is resolved and rejected
if it maps to a private / loopback / link-local / reserved address, and HTTP redirects are
NOT followed (a redirect could hop to an internal target that bypasses the up-front check).
