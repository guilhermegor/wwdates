"""Zip extraction seam — idempotent, optional, password-aware.

A reusable place for "unzip this file (maybe password-protected), but only when needed".
``zipfile`` is stdlib, so no coupling seam is strictly required — this module exists for the
*behaviour*: opt-in extraction, idempotent (skip when the target is already present), and a
caller-supplied password (from ``.env``), never hard-coded.

The ``*_to_memory`` functions are the on-disk trio's counterparts for when the extracted
bytes are consumed immediately (parsed, streamed, hashed) and never need to hit the disk —
returning all members, a subset, or a single member.
